# Project definition

This project compares Huffman coding and Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithms on text compression.

The program takes a text file as an input and compresses it to smaller size.
It can also decompress the compressed file to it's original form losslessly.

When compressed the text files should be anywhere from 20% to 90% smaller in size. 

### Data structures
Huffman coding uses a huffman tree as data structure.
Lempel-Ziv-Welch uses dictionary.

Programming language: Python
Documentation language: English
